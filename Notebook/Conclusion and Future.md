An IoT-based environmental monitoring system was designed and implemented using an ESP32 microcontroller, DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, and MQTT communication protocol. Further, Node-RED was integrated into the system for data visualization to visualize the environmental parameters in real time. The designed system was able to measure temperature and humidity levels, transmit the measured data to an MQTT broker, and display the readings on an interactive dashboard consisting of several gauges and charts.
Results showed that there is stable connectivity in MQTT, low latency in the transmission of data, and accurate sensor performance within the environmental conditions tested. Besides, having a NeoPixel RGB LED offered an intuitive and immediate visual indication of temperature ranges: blue for cold, green for normal, yellow for warm, and red for hot conditions. This further enhanced the usability of the system, whereby one could have real-time awareness without necessarily having to monitor the dashboard constantly.
Overall, the prototype has shown high reliability, responsiveness, and scalability.[8] Hence, it may be used as a base model for more advanced IoT applications for smart homes, industrial monitoring, and precision agriculture. Future work may proceed with the incorporation of more sensors, on-cloud analytics, and energy efficiency to enable the large-scale deployment of intelligent environmental monitoring systems.
